Signature is a handwritten depiction of someoneâ€™s name or a mark that a person writes on the documents as a proof of identity. It has now become one of the important identity to verify a person. It is used as authenticate a human identity in post office, bank, identity cards like passport, voter card, etc. Thus verifying signature is very important.
Signature recognition systems utilize various techniques often involving a combination of hardware and software to analyse and authenticate signature. It has various application in security, authentication, verification, and legal documents. This can be performed in two ways:1. Static and 2. Dynamic. In static the shape of the signature image after it is written while in case of dynamic it captures the temporal and spatial information of the signature during the writing process. Both methods use different techniques and algorithms to extract features and compare signatures. Signature recognition is a challenging task due to the variability and complexity of signatures, as well as the possibility of forgery and fraud. It is noticed that signature depends on many factors like state of the person, body position, writing surface, environment factors, etc. It is hard to include all the factors. Our project we have relied on Image processing and CNN (Convolution Neural Network) to enhance the quality of the input and to detect the crest-trough for forgery detection. It is one of the most effective methodologies for detecting whether or not the signature is real. CNN is extremely effective system for recognition task because it is way higher at extracting necessary data for classification.


Spiral Model is being Used to Build the Project.The reason behind using this model is that ,The Spiral SDLC model is particularly suited for projects with high uncertainty or those that involve complex requirements. Signature recognition can be a challenging task that often requires iterative refinement and continuous improvement to achieve accuracy. The Spiral model allows for incremental development and incorporates feedback from users or stakeholders at each iteration.
Since signature recognition algorithms may need adjustments, improvements, and adaptations based on real-world usage and diverse signature samples, the Spiral model's iterative approach provides the flexibility to refine the system gradually and make necessary changes as the project progresses. This can lead to a more robust and accurate signature recognition solution over time.
